/* Code to simulate rolling three six-sided dice (D6)
 * User first types in seed value
 * Use seed value as argument to srand()
 * Call roll_three to generate three integers, 1-6
 * Print result "%d %d %d "
 * If triple, print "Triple!\n"
 * If it is not a triple but it is a dobule, print "Double!\n"
 * Otherwise print "\n"
